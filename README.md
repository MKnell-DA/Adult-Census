This Kaggle challenge is one of a selection of curated project challenges as per the link provided in the instructions for this capstone assignment.

The census data set contains information on individuals surveyed including whether the individual has an income above or below 50k. The prediction task is to determine 
whether a person makes over 50k a year.
